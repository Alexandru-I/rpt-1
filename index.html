          5.9 liters in order to allow the engine to have a higher redline of 8,800 rpm. SSC had stated that the
          power output would be rated at 1,350 hp (1,007 kW; 1,369 PS) or 1,750 hp (1,305 kW; 1,774 PS) on E85 fuel,

          Audi's ultimate 'top-tier' high-performance trim level, positioned a noticeable step above the "S" model
          specification level of Audi's regular model range line-up. Like all Audi "RS" models, the RS 6 pioneers some
          of Audi's newest and most advanced engineering and technology, and so could be described as a halo vehicle,
          with the latest RS 6 Performance having the equal most powerful internal combustion engine out of all Audi
          models, with the same horsepower and torque as the physically larger Audi S8 Plus. Unlike the A6 and S6,
          however, the RS 6's engines in the C5 and C6 iterations have not been shared with any other vehicle in Audi's
          lineup. However, for the C7 generation, the Audi RS 6 has the same 4.0L bi-turbo V8 engine as the Audi RS 7,
          with both being positioned at the top of the Audi S and RS range, and detuned variants of the same engines are
          found in the Audi S8, Audi A8, and Audi S6.</p>

          Superleggera name which is a tribute to Carrozzeria Touring Superleggera, who helped Aston Martin develop
          their lightest grand tourers in the 1960s and 1970s.</p>
